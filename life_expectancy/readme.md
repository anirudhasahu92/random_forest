## General Information
This project focuses on building a predictive model to estimate life expectancy based on various input features. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately predict life expectancy in different countries, potentially aiding in identifying factors that influence overall health and well-being.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** The core programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.
- **Pandas:** For data loading, cleaning, and manipulation.
- **NumPy:** For numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning tasks, including model building, training, and evaluation.
- **Random Forest Regressor:** The machine learning algorithm employed for building the prediction model.


## Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains information about life expectancy and various health and socio-economic indicators for different countries.  It provides insights into factors that may influence overall health and life expectancy.

## Data Preprocessing
- **Handling Missing Values:** The dataset contained missing values in several features. These missing values were addressed by filling them with the mean value of each respective column. This approach was chosen based on the assumption that the missing values are randomly distributed and do not significantly skew the data.
- **Encoding Categorical Features:** The dataset had some categorical features which were converted into numerical representations using Label Encoding. This step is necessary as machine learning models generally require numerical input.
- **Outlier Handling:** The project decided not to remove outliers as Random Forest models are generally robust to their presence. This choice saves effort in data cleaning and allows the model to learn patterns potentially concealed within the outliers.
- **Feature Reduction:**  The project didn't reduce the number of features as Random Forest models can efficiently handle a relatively large number of input features without a significant performance degradation. Feature reduction could potentially result in loss of valuable information.


## Model Building
- **Feature Selection:** All features in the dataset were utilized for training the model.
- **Model Selection:** A Random Forest Regressor was chosen for building the predictive model. Random Forests are robust to outliers and can handle a large number of features effectively, making them well-suited for this type of task. They are also known for their good generalization performance and resistance to overfitting.
- **Model Training:** The Random Forest model was trained on a training dataset with a train-test split of 0.8. This ensures a substantial amount of data is used for training, allowing the model to learn meaningful patterns.

## Results
- The model achieved a good level of accuracy on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in predicting life expectancy. This suggests that the selected features and model are well-suited for the task of predicting life expectancy.

## Conclusions
- Random Forest Regressor proved to be an effective model for predicting life expectancy based on the chosen features. 
- The model's accuracy demonstrates its potential for applications in understanding factors affecting life expectancy and developing health interventions.
- Further analysis could involve dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., PCA) to explore if they can lead to a faster model without affecting accuracy. This could be investigated to optimize the model for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
